👋 Hi, I’m @debiangee.
🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Data Engineering. I am still a newbie and don't know what I'm doing yet. I love to learn as much as possible, but my memory is just average.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Open Source Software and Data Wrangling. I hope to learn more in these areas.
📫 You can reach me by emailing me at lgbespiritu@gmail.com.
😄 Pronouns: He / Him, but I am an ally!
⚡ Fun fact: I work in a very traditional bank. I'm trying to learn coding to break away from my current role!
